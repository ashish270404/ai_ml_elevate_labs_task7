This task applies Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset from Kaggle. The dataset was loaded from a CSV file, cleaned, and preprocessed by encoding the diagnosis labels and selecting two relevant features (radius_mean and texture_mean) for 2D visualization. The data was split into training and testing sets, and features were standardized using StandardScaler. A linear SVM (kernel='linear') and a non-linear SVM with a radial basis function kernel (kernel='rbf') were trained to compare classification performance. Decision boundaries were visualized to illustrate the effect of kernel choice. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the regularization parameter C and kernel coefficient gamma. Finally, model performance was evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, along with cross-validation to estimate generalization performance. This task highlights how SVMs handle both linearly and non-linearly separable data and the importance of hyperparameter tuning.
